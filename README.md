# linux-2.6.23.y

This is not an official branch of the Linux kernel.

This is a fork of [dandel/linux-2.6.32.y](https://github.com/dandel/linux-2.6.32.y) to bring my own changes to branch `master-imapx200`.

My contribution aims to be able to compile a kernel natively against GCC 5.x and not necessarily using cross-compilation.
